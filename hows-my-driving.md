I hope you always feel comfortable letting us know how you think the
course is going, how you feel you are doing, and how we can improve or
help you do better. For various reasons a student may not always feel
comfortable giving this feedback directly. I still want to hear from
you! Send an anonymous email. Any number of email providers will let
you register a new account from which you can sent email to [the
professor]({{ site.author.email }}) anonymously. If you don't think
you will need or want follow-up correspondence, then you could even
use a fully anonymous disposable temporary email address. A variety of
providers offer this service; [here is
one](https://www.guerrillamail.com/).

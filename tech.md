The following is a list of technologies with which I expect you to
familiarize yourself and be prepared to use as a part of participating
in our class.

## Course Homepage

I constructed our course homepage as a Jekyll site built with Github
Pages. You should directly submit corrections and improvements as
[pull requests]({{ site.sourceurl }}{{ site.repository }}). Every page
on this website has a direct links to its `.md` file in this
repository.

If you are unfamiliar with making pull requests, you can find plenty of documentation both from your terminal
and [on the
web](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

## Racket

[Download](https://download.racket-lang.org/) and install Racket and
the DrRacket integrated development environment. To begin with, I will
use DrRacket in front of the classroom to demonstrate Racket and
miniKanren programming, and I want you all to follow along and to
practice during designated practice periods.
